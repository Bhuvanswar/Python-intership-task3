# Python-intership-task3
# News Headlines Web Scraper

This project contains a Python script that scrapes the top news headlines from a news website and saves them in a `.txt` file. The script uses the `requests` library to fetch the HTML of a webpage and `BeautifulSoup` from `bs4` to parse the HTML and extract the headlines.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `requests`: To send HTTP requests to fetch HTML content from the website.
- `beautifulsoup4`: To parse the HTML content and extract headlines.

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
